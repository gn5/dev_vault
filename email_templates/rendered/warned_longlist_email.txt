Dear stakeholder,

/lustre data you own is scheduled for automated deletion in 10 days.

Full listing (1000 files) can be found in the attachment.
This listing is also available on the farm at
/lustre/../projects/unixgroup1/filelist.txt

You MUST act now to prevent any of these files from being deleted in 10 days!

To do so, you can mark any of these files to be kept (i.e. preventing deletion) and/or automatically archived to humgen Irods, by using command-line tool 'vault' on the farm.
Please refer to 'vault' documentation at https://confluence.sanger.ac.uk/display/HGI/Vault+Reference+Manual+for+Users or ask HGI.

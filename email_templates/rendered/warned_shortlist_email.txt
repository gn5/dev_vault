Dear stakeholder,

The following 3 files are scheduled for automated deletion in 10 days:

/lustre/../projects/unixgroup1/file1
/lustre/../projects/unixgroup1/file2
/lustre/../projects/unixgroup2/file3

You MUST act now to prevent any of these files from being deleted in 10 days!

To do so, you can mark any of these files to be kept (i.e. preventing deletion) and/or automatically archived to humgen Irods, by using command-line tool 'vault' on the farm.
Please refer to 'vault' documentation at https://confluence.sanger.ac.uk/display/HGI/Vault+Reference+Manual+for+Users or ask HGI.

Size information of file list summarised by farm Unix group:

* unixgroup1 group in /lustre/../projects/unixgroup1:
  10 GiB across 2 files

* unixgroup2 group in /lustre/../projects/unixgroup2:
  5 KiB across 1 files
